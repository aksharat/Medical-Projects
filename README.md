# Medical-Projects
Repository for all biomedical image processing projects, specifically in classification, localization, and segmentation. This repository is designed to replicate and build upon state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in these domains.

## Notebooks

### 1. Classification_Swin_NIH_chestXRay.ipynb
This project uses a Swin Transformer-based model for the multi-class and multi-label classification of chest X-rays from the NIH ChestX-ray dataset. The model aims to detect various thoracic diseases by analyzing the X-ray images.

### 2. DINO_localization_vindr.ipynb
This project employs the DINO (Self-Distillation with No Labels) approach for image localization tasks on the VinDr dataset. The bounding boxes are provided to use as reference for the end results.

### 3. TestResults_Localization.ipynb
This notebook provides test results and evaluation metrics for the localization models applied on medical imaging datasets. It includes performance analysis and visualization of the model's predictions.

### 4. pneumothorax_segmentation.ipynb
This project focuses on segmentation tasks, specifically targeting the detection and segmentation of pneumothorax conditions in chest X-ray images. The model is trained and tested on a relevant dataset to identify and segment pneumothorax regions.
